This program reads name files (.csv) which were published by Finland's Population Register Centre in autumn 2017. In the name files one line has two columns, first for name and the second for the quantity of those names given to individuals in Finland. The program makes a linked list of a name file with name-structs. After reading the file the user can make the program analyze the name file, in which case the program computes how much memory was allocated for the linked list for the particular name file and how much of that memory is in useful purpose among other things described in detail in the result_list -header file. The results of these analyzes are stored in other linked list. The user can read multiple name files, print the name_list, read from the name file, analyze name files, print the results of these analyzes, both in the terminal and in a file, and empty the results.
