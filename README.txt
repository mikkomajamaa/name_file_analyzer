 2018 This program reads namefiles (.csv) which were published by Finland's Population Register Centre in autumn 2017. One line has two columns, first for name and the second for the quantity of those names in Finland. The program makes a linked list of a namefile with name-structs. After reading a file the user can make the program analyze the namefile, in which case the program computes how much memory was allocated for the linked list for the particular namefile and how much of that memory is in useful purpose among other things described in detail in the resultList-headerfile. The results of these analyzes are stored in other linked list. The user can read multiple namefiles, print the namelist read from the namefile, analyze namefiles, print the results of the analyzes, both in the terminal and in a file, and empty the results.
